description: A profile for creating Micronaut applications with a Vue.js frontend
instructions: |
    This profile provides a client/server multi-project build structure. The server Micronaut app is using the service profile.

    The Vue client app has been built via the Vue CLI (https://cli.vuejs.org), using the webpack template.

    For support, please use the Micronaut Gitter Channel (https://gitter.im/micronautfw/) or open an issue on Github: https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-profiles/issues
